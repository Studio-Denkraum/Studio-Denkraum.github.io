# Ability-System    

2 active abilities  
1-n passive slots  
1 movement-skill slot  

<ul>
  <li>active abilites are NOT on equipment (the idea was that ability1 can be assigned to the “right” arm/hand and ability2 to the “left” arm/hand)</li>
  <li>each equipment can have passive slots (on torso maybe more slots than on head equipment)</li>
  <li>each passive slot is assigned to either ability1 or ability2 and influences these</li>
  <li>Movement Abilities have no passives “for now” (because you would have to implement special passives)</li>
</ul>
